this dir holds source file of vtd u-arch (wip)

These source files could be run on top of uSim simulator.
Thus $USIM_ROOT env variable must be set and
> source $USIM_ROOT/source_me.csh
must be run. A $DUT_ROOT variable should be set to point to 
directory where this README file is located. 

Just run following command in parent's dir
> source source_me.csh 

1. command line invocation:
    To run some test one do the following:

    1. run test bench of merge unit:
    > microSim.py --module tb_merge --top dut --test main -f

    2. run test bench of translation engine 
    > microSim.py --module tb_translation_engine --top dut --test main -f

    3. To run unittest of translation engine (without uSim)
    > $DUT_ROOT/tests/tb_translation_engine_functional.py 
    
2. GUI invocation:
    read $USIM_ROOT/README file to see how to run it in gui
