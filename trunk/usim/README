This file describe uSim project. uSim is an event driven simulator.

when working with using following env variables should be set:
USIM_ROOT - full path to uSim simulator directory (where this file is located)
PYTHONPATH - all search paths where uSim will be looking for designs to be
             simulated

Before start working:
please set USIM_ROOT env var* and then source source_me.csh to set up remain 
search paths

*for example: 
> modpath -n 1 -v USIM_ROOT `pwd`

uSim can be run in two ways:
a. command line interface:
    uSim executable called microSim.py, to see help use:
    > microSim --help
    
    there are some test examples in $USIM_ROOT/tests dir which you can run
    
    1. ring oscillator
    To run ring oscillator for 10 ticks use the following command:
    > microSim.py --module ring_osc --top top --test main --resolveZeroTime -u 10
    
    2. a ports example:
    To run a-port ALU model example use this command:
    > microSim.py --module aports_example --top dut --test main --resolveZeroTime -f

b. GUI:
    uSim's GUI may be used to run uSim as well. To run the GUI use:
    > $USIM_ROOT/gui/micro_sim_gui.py &
    this will open uSim's GUI. There you can choose 
    1. search paths where uSim will search to locate the simulated module (--module argument)
        by default all paths from PYTHONPATH are visible
    2. models to be simulated

    Then type top unit name and test name within the loaded module
    Eventually choose how long you wanna run your model (for example: forever, 5 steps or unit tick 20)
    Then click run

    After that you may see on the left side a 'schematic' of loaded design
    all prints will happen in source shell (where from the GUI was invoked)

Source Code Browser:
use following command to browse uSim's source code:
> firefox $USIM_ROOT/docs/index.html &
