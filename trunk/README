In this dir there are 2 sub-dirs:

usim         - holds uSim simulator source files and some tests. 

uarc_dev     - holds all files related to development of some micro arch' 
             These files could be run on top of uSim simulator.

both directories are standalone GIT repos

In order to be able to run uSim on top of uarc_dev files do the 
following source:
> source ./source_me.csh
It will setup all env variables and run source_me scripts of both projects.

Then proceed reading ./usim/README and uarc_dev/README files on how to 
get things done...
